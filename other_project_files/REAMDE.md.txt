# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to classify iris flowers based on their measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

## Steps Taken:
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loaded and explored the Iris dataset.
2. **Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning**: Tested several machine learning models and tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
3. **Model Saving**: Saved the best performing model using pickle.
4. **Web App**: Built a simple Streamlit web app to make predictions based on user inputs.

## Requirements:
1. Python 3.x
2. Libraries:
   - scikit-learn
   - pandas
   - matplotlib
   - seaborn
   - streamlit
   - pickle

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run streamlit_app.py`
